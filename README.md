## SkillPass

*_Problem:_*
Freelancers and gig workers struggle to prove their skills across platforms. Traditional platforms own their ratings, and most credentials aren't verifiable.

*_Solution:_*
SkillPass lets users mint Soulbound NFTs that represent verified skills and work history. These NFTs are stored on-chain, non-transferable, and viewable as a portfolio tied to the user's wallet.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
