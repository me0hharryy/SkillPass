### _Problem:_
Freelancers and gig workers struggle to prove their skills across platforms. Traditional platforms own their ratings, and most credentials aren't verifiable.

### _Solution:_
SkillPass lets users mint Soulbound NFTs that represent verified skills and work history. These NFTs are stored on-chain, non-transferable, and viewable as a portfolio tied to the user's wallet.
